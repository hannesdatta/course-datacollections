# Project ideas

*Note: The final team projects (and team allocations) are available on the course's (non-public) Canvas page.*

Here's a list with a couple of project ideas. __Don't feel restricted by these options, though!__ There are plenty of other great ideas (e.g., see the [examples section](../../../examples)), and we encourage you to think of applications in which you use two or more APIs, or in which you combine web scraping with relevant APIs.

When using a proprietary data sources requiring login (e.g., Netflix) or API credentials (e.g., Twitter API), make sure you can *actually* get access to the accounts (and potentially share those with team members).



<!--Research Context

Skilling up in web scraping and APIs requires practice, and conducting a group project is a great way to learn more about any facet of data- or computer science. Choose one of the following questions to explore further or pitch your own one during one of the live meetings in the course!
